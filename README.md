## Instructions

Project Submission

You will write code to store a list of your favorite movies, including box art imagery and a movie trailer URL. You will then use your code to generate a static web page allowing visitors to browse the movies and watch the trailer.

How will I complete this project?

* If you haven't already, install Python
* Create a data structure (i.e., a Python Class) to store your favorite movies, including movie title, box art URL (or poster URL) and a YouTube link to the movie trailer.
* Create multiple instances of that Python Class to represent your favorite movies; group all the instances together in a list.
* To help you generate a website that displays these movies, we have provided a Python module called [fresh_tomatoes.py](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-hosted-downloads/ud036/fresh_tomatoes.py) - this module has a function called open_movies_page that takes in one argument, which is a list of movies and creates an HTML file which visualizes all of your favorite movies.
* Ensure your website renders correctly when you attempt to load it in a browser.
* Get started with this helpful [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1joDQNQl_4icYYm6tM_F9ch5hZEH_f157hlljSUGOLWs/pub?embedded=true).

For this stage, you will need to submit a zip of your project files saved as movie_website.zip. Your zip should include three Python files: media.py, entertainment_center.py, and fresh_tomatoes.py. Your submission will be evaluated according to the following rubric.
